## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles

Our roadmap is built on these architectural principles:

1. **Dual Execution Model**: Maintain both standard Spark and Databricks modes
2. **Thread-Local Design**: Preserve thread safety and parallel processing
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Keep behavior configurable without code changes
4. **Cloud-Native**: Design for containerization and orchestration
5. **Enterprise-Ready**: Include monitoring, logging, and security features

### Code Standards

- **Python 3.9+**: Use modern Python features and type hints
- **Pydantic Models**: Use for configuration validation
- **Thread Safety**: Design for concurrent execution
- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful failure recovery
- **Testing**: Maintain >90% coverage with unit and integration tests

### Technology Alignment

When contributing, align with our technology choices:

**Core Stack**:
- PySpark 3.4+ for data processing
- Pydantic for configuration management
- Poetry for dependency management
- Docker for containerization

**Future Integrations** (from roadmap):
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Prometheus for metrics
- Apache Kafka for streaming
- Multiple database platforms

## üìã Roadmap Contribution Process

### Quarterly Reviews

We conduct quarterly roadmap reviews where community input is essential:

1. **Feedback Collection** (Month 1 of quarter)
   - Survey current users about pain points
   - Collect feature requests and use cases
   - Review market trends and competitive landscape

2. **Prioritization** (Month 2 of quarter)
   - Assess development capacity
   - Re-evaluate feature importance
   - Consider technical dependencies

3. **Planning Update** (Month 3 of quarter)
   - Update roadmap timelines
   - Communicate changes to community
   - Plan next quarter's work

### How to Influence the Roadmap

#### 1. Feature Requests
- **Use Case Description**: Explain the business need
- **Technical Requirements**: Detail implementation considerations
