## State Management Features

### Idempotency Implementation
```python
# Intelligent extraction checking
def is_extraction_needed(self, table_key: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if extraction is needed based on:
    - Existing state and status
    - File integrity verification
    - Window consistency checks
    - Force reprocessing flags
    """
```

### Window Validation
```python
# 24-hour window consistency
def validate_extraction_window_consistency(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Validates that all extractions use consistent 24-hour windows:
    - Checks extraction start/end times
    - Identifies window drift
    - Ensures pipeline-wide consistency
    """
```

### Progress Tracking
```python
# Comprehensive progress monitoring
def get_pipeline_progress(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Returns detailed pipeline progress including:
    - Overall pipeline status and timing
    - Individual table completion rates
    - Status breakdown (pending/completed/failed)
    - Restart count and checkpoint information
    """
```

### Failure Recovery
```python
# Smart failure handling
def reset_failed_extractions(self) -> int:
    """
    Resets failed extractions for retry:
    - Identifies failed extractions
    - Resets status to pending
    - Preserves failure history
    - Returns count of reset extractions
    """
```

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Basic Pipeline with State Management
```python
from data_extractor.stateful_core import StatefulDataExtractor

# Initialize with state management
extractor = StatefulDataExtractor(
    state_dir="state",
    run_id="daily_extract_20250123"
)

# Extract tables (idempotent)
results = extractor.extract_tables(table_configs)

# Check progress
progress = extractor.get_pipeline_status()
print(f"Completion: {progress['completion_rate']:.1f}%")
```

### 2. Restart Capability
```python
# Application restart scenario
extractor = StatefulDataExtractor(
    state_dir="state",
    run_id="daily_extract_20250123"  # Same run_id
)

# Automatically resumes from previous state
results = extractor.extract_tables(table_configs)  # Skips completed tables
```

### 3. Force Reprocessing
```python
# Force specific table reprocessing
success = extractor.force_reprocess_table("oracle_prod.sales.customers")
if success:
    results = extractor.extract_tables(table_configs)  # Will re-extract forced table
```

### 4. Failure Recovery
```python
# Reset all failed extractions for retry
reset_count = extractor.reset_failed_extractions()
print(f"Reset {reset_count} failed extractions")

# Re-run pipeline
results = extractor.extract_tables(table_configs)
```
